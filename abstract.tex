\section*{Abstract}
This report examines the harmonic motion of a spring. 
It does this by examining the physical laws of springs and mechanical pyhisics more broadly. 
These laws are then used to propose a mathematical model of the motion of an object hanging in a spring.

To easily solve these differential equations found in physics, this report examines them more generally. 
It describes the complete solution to the second order linear homogeneus differential equation, and gives a partial proof that the solution proposed is the complete solution. 

Having explained how to solve the differential equation, it then examines experiments meant to test wether the model of differential equations proposed about the motion are acurate.

Through 3 experiments it finds, that the second order linear homogeneus differential equation is a good description of the motion.
However it also finds that the description is not perfect and then proposes an improvement of the model that makes the equations non-linear.
It argues why this improved model describes the motion better but it also shows why the model is a much harder mathematical problem to solve. 

The report then examines how this physical model can be used to describe parts a car suspension system.
